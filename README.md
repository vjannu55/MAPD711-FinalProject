Doctor Appointment Booking App

Our mobile app streamlines the process of booking doctor appointments, saving valuable time typically spent on phone calls or waiting in clinic queues. This platform allows patients to effortlessly schedule appointments with their preferred doctors, eliminating the hassle of lengthy phone conversations.

For doctors, our app offers the convenience of managing their schedules and updating their locations as needed. They can also modify their consultation fees directly through the app, providing flexibility and ease of control.

Patients gain access to an extensive list of doctors across various specialties in every city nationwide. They can easily browse and select their desired doctor, booking appointments directly from their smartphones.

Upon booking, doctors have the option to review and approve appointments based on their availability. Once confirmed, our app triggers instant push notifications to notify patients of their approved appointment. Additionally, the app provides the functionality to print or share confirmed appointments for convenience and record-keeping.
